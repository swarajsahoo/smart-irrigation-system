Overview

The Smart Irrigation System is designed to monitor soil moisture and temperature in real-time, ensuring optimal water usage for agriculture. This system uses IoT-enabled devices to provide precise, data-driven irrigation management to reduce water wastage and improve crop health.

Features

Soil Moisture Monitoring: Continuously measures soil moisture levels to prevent over- or under-watering.

Temperature Monitoring: Tracks ambient temperature to optimize irrigation schedules.

Real-Time Data: Displays live data using sensors and IoT.

Automated Watering: Triggers irrigation automatically based on predefined moisture thresholds.

User-Friendly Dashboard: A web-based interface for monitoring and controlling the system.

Energy Efficient: Uses low-power components to maximize efficiency.

System Architecture

The system consists of:

Sensors: Soil moisture sensors and temperature sensors.

Microcontroller: Arduino/ESP32 for data processing and communication.

Communication: Wi-Fi module for transmitting data to the cloud.

Cloud Platform: Stores and visualizes data in real time.

Actuators: Water pumps controlled by relays for irrigation.
